I am a final-year PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Caltech, with a minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics. I have the privilege of being advised by [Domniki Asimaki](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/domniki), and co-advised by [Zachary E. Ross](https://ross.caltech.edu/) and [Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://kamyar.page/).

My research develops and applies novel machine learning techniques to solve complex scientific problems. I focus on operator learning theory, generative models in function spaces (particularly flow matching), and Bayesian methods. These approaches are applied to critical challenges in domains such as earthquake engineering and the use of multimodal large language models for large-scale PDE solving.

Looking forward, my long-term goal is to build AI systems that unify a deep understanding of the physical world with sophisticated reasoning and adaptive response. This vision involves bridging fundamental research in areas like generative AI, multimodal LLM, operator learning and reinforcement learning with the practical deployment of robust, intelligent agents capable of operating in complex and dynamic environments.
